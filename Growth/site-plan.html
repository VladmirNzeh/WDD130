        Growth should be taken seriously since it is a crucial part of our lives. It is important for everyone to grow and develop.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Growth can come in different ways, it can come in form of self-improvement or from external sources such as friends, family, and others. It can also come in the form of a combination of both. When we grow, we are able to improve our quality of life. We tend to grow more in the short term and less in the long term.
        Growth should be taught in institutions of learning and should be encouraged. Growth should be a way of life for everyone. the abiliy to grow should be given to everyone. How far you grow in life is up to you. don't loose the chance to grow. Have you ever thought about being successful in life? Have you ever thought about being successful in your career? All this thoughts are attributed to a Growth mindset

        Colored paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        There was a some time ago, when i was young and, i was always looking for something to do. I was always thinking of how to do something. but, i was not sure, of what to do because I never had the opportunity to do anything.
        Things at that time was very hard, and there was no money to help my dreams come true, but i was always thinking of how to do something.I even went as far as working in a car wash store. I eventually worked in the car wash store until i was able to get a job in a local water 
        factory, at that time I was able to foot some of my bills without asking for nothing from my parets. that really lessened the burden for my parents who were catering for the six of my sibliings. It was harsh, but I had the growth mindset and I was able to do something.
