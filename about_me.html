            <p>Hello everyone, I am from Lagos, Nigeria. I am from an extended family of 5 siblings.
                I schooled in federal polytechnic, Zungeru, Niger state. trust me, it's not a too friendly place,
                but it's worth it.
                I have been a member of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints for awhile now, and since joining this fold,
                I can confidently say that i am blessed beyond measures. The prophets, the doctrines, the covenants,
                the teachings, the testimonies, the words of wisdom, the words of knowledge, have really brought me
                this far in my journey of faith and Godly learning. I hoe you reading this can also join me and have
                testimonies of God's faithfulness, and also be a witness of Jesus Christ.
            </p>
            <p>I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in BYU-Idaho, where I am studying web and computer programming.
                I love innovations, technologies, science and human evolution, and I am always ready to learn and grow even if
                it's just a little bit tasking. I appreciate the opportunity given to be able to build my own websites and webpages,
            and also getting to meet and know all my coursemates and tutors< Thank you for checking out this page, remain blessed!/p>
